            <img src="./article-files/tidal-energy.avif" alt="">
            <p class="s2-cards-content">🌊 What is Tidal Energy?<br>
                Tidal energy harnesses the movement of ocean tides to generate electricity. The rise and fall of tides happen because of the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on Earth’s oceans. Since tides are predictable (unlike wind or sunlight), tidal energy is considered reliable and renewable.Modern tidal power plants use various methods to capture this energy: barrages (dams that trap and release water), underwater turbines (spinning like wind turbines beneath the waves), and tidal lagoons (man-made coastal reservoirs).</p>

            <h2 class="r-more">read more</h2>

            <div class="e-info">

                <p class="s2-cards-content">With a high energy density — thanks to water’s natural weight and force — tidal power can generate significant electricity even at low speeds. It’s a long-lasting solution too, with infrastructure lifespans exceeding a century.

                    While challenges like high upfront costs and potential marine ecosystem impacts exist, advancements in eco-friendly turbine design and site selection are helping to minimize these effects.
                    
                    Tidal energy stands as a beacon of sustainable innovation — proving that with the ocean’s rhythm, we can power a greener tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>WISA Woodsat is a CubeSat — a type of small satellite — measuring 10x10x10 centimeters and weighing about 1 kilogram. Unlike traditional satellites built from aluminum or carbon composites, this unique spacecraft features birch plywood panels, similar to what you'd find in home woodworking projects. Of course, this wood isn't ordinary — it's specially dried and coated with a thin layer of aluminum oxide to withstand the rigors of space.</p>

                    <p>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION
                        The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station.
                        LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts  <button class="btn1">read more</button> technique without screws or glue.
                        Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight.</p>

                    <p>The Asteroid Mining Corporation (AMC), a UK-based company, has unveiled the Space Capable Asteroid Robotic Explorer (SCAR-E), a six-legged robot engineered for asteroid exploration and mining tasks. SCAR-E is designed to traverse and operate on the irregular and low-gravity surfaces of asteroids, making it a versatile tool for both space missions and terrestrial applications. AMC's partnership with Tohoku University's Space Robotics Lab has been instrumental in developing SCAR-E, positioning it as a significant advancement in space robotics. ​</p>
                    <p>
                        The company developed the SCAR-E six-legged robot to outperform Spot, Boston Dynamic's    
                        
                    robot dog."We are coming for you Boston Dynamics," proclaimed Asteroid Mining CEO Mitch Hunter-Scullion. "You have four legs. We have six. Our go-to-market strategy is to go to the industrial inspection market and go to places which four legged robots cannot."                
                    
                    This includes scaling walls and inspecting ship hulls on Earth, all the way to investigating lunar craters and prospecting asteroids in space.
 
                    SCAR-E's mechanical and electronic components are well-protected against the wear and tear of superfine dust from lunar regolith and are designed to withstand exposure to radiation, launch accelerations, and extreme temperatures, making the spider-looking robot well-suited for space.
                        
                    These adaptive functions also make the robot ideal for reducing human exposure to hostile environments here on Earth. <button class="btn1">read more</button>   <a href="">SCAR-E Asteroid Mining Robot

                    <p>A solar sail spacecraft moves using sunlight itself — not by solar panels generating electricity, but by harnessing the pressure of photons (light particles) pushing against an ultra-thin, reflective sail. It’s like a futuristic sailboat, but with sunlight instead of wind.</p>

                    <ul style="padding: 10px 0px 0px 40px;">
                        <li class="li-sapcecraft">A massive, lightweight, reflective sail (often made from materials like Mylar or Kapton) unfurls in space.</li>
                        <li class="li-sapcecraft">Photons from the Sun hit the sail, transferring momentum — even though they have no mass — and slowly push the spacecraft forward.</li>
                        <li class="li-sapcecraft">The pressure is tiny, but over time, it builds up to high speeds (potentially tens of thousands of kilometers per hour).</li>

                    <p>The Advanced Composite Solar Sail System demonstration uses a twelve-unit (12U) CubeSat built by NanoAvionics to test a new composite boom made from flexible polymer and carbon <button class="btn1">read more</button> fiber materials that are stiffer and lighter than previous boom designs. The mission’s primary objective is to successfully demonstrate new boom deployment, but once deployed, the team also hopes to prove the sail’s performance.  </p>

                    <p>Like a sailboat turning to capture the wind, the solar sail can adjust its orbit by angling its sail. After evaluating the boom deployment, the mission will test a series of maneuvers to change the spacecraft’s orbit and gather data for potential future missions with even larger sails.</p>
